A bunch of Java for usage in my Comp Sci class. Expect messy code.

Rainforest Prime offers a discount to customers depending on the amount of their purchase before taxes. Write the code only.

Purchase			Discount

* 0 - 99.99			5%

* 100.00 – 499.99		10%

* 500.00 – 999.99		15%

* over 999.99			25%

Write a program that prompts the user for money they spent and displays the appropriate discount. Use the percentage format from the NumberFormat class. Use switch-case statement for bonus marks.
